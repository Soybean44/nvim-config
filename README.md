# Neovim Config

This is my dead simple neovim config. Minimal plugins, minimal configuration, minimal effort.

## Philosophy

The philosophy behind this config is to better understand base neovim without needing any bloat surrounding it. All of this started after I found out that omni-complete works out of the box in python when doing some embedded development, no configuration required. This combined with the fact that omni-complete now works with lsp in neovim 0.11 means that this config is insanely ergonomic. The best part is some of my most effective workflows are still here and work amazingly. 

## Plugins

I do use vim 0.12's native plugin manager to install the bare minimum of plugins, this includes 

- Catppuccin (because it looks pretty)
- Oil.nvim (for better file-system management) 
- Mini.pick (for fast file/help searching)
- Typst-Preview (for amazing typst workflows)
- Nvim-Treesitter (for sane highlighting)
