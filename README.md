# Neovim Config - Sovereign Shahid
This config was made so I can standardize my configs over my many devices.

Currently it is set up to work with the following languages:
- Rust
- C / C++
- Python

## Other Notes
Some file locations have been manually coded in, (e.g. debugpy path). 
You need to change this for your local system depending on where the files are located
